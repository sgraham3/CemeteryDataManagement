Cemetery Management can be used to develop an authoritative cemetery and gravesite inventory and share gravesite and burial information with the public.
Cemeteries are valuable historic resources that offer insight into a community's unique population. They also serve as memorials that comfort people as they process the loss of loved ones. Unfortunately, cemeteries are threatened by encroaching development, the effects of extreme weather, and even a lack of usable space, and when they fall into disuse or are neglected, they can be problematic for their communities. Improving cemetery management is key to addressing these issues, but a local government cannot effectively manage these community assets unless it knows how many gravesites each cemetery has, who owns each gravesite, and who, if anyone, is buried there. Therefore, the first step a local government must take to manage one or more cemeteries is to create a gravesite inventory.
The Cemetery Management solution delivers a set of capabilities that help local governments inventory publicly owned cemeteries and gravesites, monitor cemetery operations, and share gravesite and burial information with the public.
