### Assign IDs to blocks
The Sequential Numbering tool can be used to assign a sequential ID to an area.

To assign sequential block IDs, complete the following steps:

1. Optionally, in the Format text box, modify the format to which you want your attributes to conform.

2. In the Start value text box, type the first attribute value in the sequence (e.g., 1).

3. In the Increment text box, type the number by which each value in the sequence is incremented (e.g., 1).

4. Starting with the first block you want to increment from, draw a line across the blocks. Click and drag the line across the blocks you want to number.

5. Click the map to end the line and stop sketching. To finish the sketch, double-click or right-click and select Finish Sketch (F2).

6. Save your edits.
