The Cemetery Management solution includes a Cemeteries feature layer.
This layer is used to store cemetery subdivisions and related burial and
ownership information.

Before creating or loading cemetery data, update the map data sources to
use the Cemeteries feature layer deployed with your solution.

To update the map data sources, complete the following steps:

1\. In the Contents pane, right-click the Cemeteries layer and click
Properties.

2\. Select Source in the Layer Properties window.

3\. Click Set Data Source.

4\. Browse to and open the Cemeteries feature layer in your Portal\'s
contents. Select Cemeteries.

5\. Click OK.

6\. Repeat the above steps for the remaining map layers and tables,
sourcing each layer with the Cemeteries layer of the same name.

Note: Do not modify the layer or table names, as they will be used in
subsequent tasks.
