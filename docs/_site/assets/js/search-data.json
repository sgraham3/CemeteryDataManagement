Other than that, you’re free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of just-the-docs and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins. Browse our documentation to learn more about how to use this theme. To get started with creating a site, simply: . | click “use this template” to create a GitHub repository | go to Settings &gt; Pages &gt; Build and deployment &gt; Source, and select GitHub Actions | .
