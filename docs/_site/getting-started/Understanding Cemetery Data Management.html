<h2 id="use-cemetery-data-management-to-load-create-and-edit-foundational-cemetery-data-used-in-applications-that-are-deployed-with-the-solution">Use Cemetery Data Management to load, create, and edit foundational cemetery data used in applications that are deployed with the Solution.</h2>
<p>Cemetery Data Management can be used to organize foundational cemetery
data in ArcGIS. This data can be loaded from existing source data or
digitized from existing cemetery maps.</p>

<p>Cemeteries are typically subdivided into a series of areas (for example,
sections, blocks, lots, and gravesites). Burial and/or ownership
information is commonly associated with a given gravesite.</p>

<p>The solution uses five layers to represent the subdivisions of a
cemetery:</p>

<p>- Cemeteries</p>

<p>- Sections</p>

<p>- Blocks</p>

<p>- Lots</p>

<p>- Gravesites</p>

<p>Related burial and ownership information is stored in two tables:</p>

<p>- Burials</p>

<p>- Owners</p>

<p>The following task groups are organized to help you load existing source
data or digitize cemetery data using hardcopy maps.</p>

<p>- Create cemetery data will guide you through creating new data using
existing hardcopy maps or related source information.</p>

<p>- Load cemetery data will guide you through loading existing GIS data
into the layers provided.</p>

<p>- Load burial and ownership information will guide you through loading
existing burial and ownership record information into the tables
provided.</p>
