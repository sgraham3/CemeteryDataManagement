<p>The Cemetery Management solution includes a Cemeteries feature layer. This layer is used to store cemetery subdivisions and related burial and ownership information.</p>

<p>Before creating or loading cemetery data, update the map data sources to use the Cemeteries feature layer deployed with your solution.</p>

<p>To update the map data sources, complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the Contents pane, right-click the Cemeteries layer and click Properties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select Source in the Layer Properties window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click Set Data Source.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Browse to and open the Cemeteries feature layer in your Portalâ€™s contents. Select Cemeteries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click OK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat the above steps for the remaining map layers and tables, sourcing each layer with the Cemeteries layer of the same name.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Do not modify the layer or table names, as they will be used in subsequent tasks.</p>
