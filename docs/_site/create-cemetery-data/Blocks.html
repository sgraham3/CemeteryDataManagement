<p>The Sequential Numbering tool can be used to assign a sequential ID to an area.</p>

<p>To assign sequential block IDs, complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally, in the Format text box, modify the format to which you want your attributes to conform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Start value text box, type the first attribute value in the sequence (e.g., 1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Increment text box, type the number by which each value in the sequence is incremented (e.g., 1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting with the first block you want to increment from, draw a line across the blocks. Click and drag the line across the blocks you want to number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the map to end the line and stop sketching. To finish the sketch, double-click or right-click and select Finish Sketch (F2).</p>
