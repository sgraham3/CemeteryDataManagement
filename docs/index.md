Cemeteries are valuable historic resources that offer insight into a community’s unique population. They also serve as memorials that comfort people as they process the loss of loved ones.

Unfortunately, cemeteries are threatened by encroaching development, the effects of extreme weather, and even a lack of usable space. When they fall into disuse or are neglected, they can be problematic for their communities.​ Improving cemetery management is key to addressing these issues, but a local government cannot effectively manage these community assets unless it knows how many gravesites each cemetery has, who owns each gravesite, and who, if anyone, is buried there.

The Cemetery Management Solution helps local governments and private cemetery organizations alike to inventory cemeteries and gravesites, monitor cemetery operations, and increase transparency and public interest.

Streamline cemetery and gravesite inventory
The Cemetery Data Management ArcGIS Pro project can be used by GIS mapping technicians to develop a cemetery and gravesite inventory from record information. A series of tasks help you create or load cemetery data, and associate related burial and ownership information to each gravesite.
